2017.271: 2.2
	- Support empty and "--" location codes in metadata files equally.
	- Add "-M" option to accept a line of metadata on the command line.
	- Right-pad SAC text headers with spaces instead of NULLs.
	- Insert network code of XX when input data has an empty network,
	this avoids generating file names beginning with a dot.
	- Reformat source according to included clang-format profile.

2017.093: 2.1
	- Update libmseed to 2.19.3.
	- Update fdzipstream sources to 2.1.
	- Remove dependency on ntwin32.mak for Windows nmake makefiles, now
	building works in plain MSVC development environments.
	- Add DEPRECATED notice to Makefile.wat and src/Makefile.wat.
	- Update licensing to GNU GPL 3.

2015.279:
	- Update to libmseed 2.17.
	- Update fdzipstream sources to 2.0 and adjust code for usage.

2013.271: 2.0
	- Update to libmseed 2.12.
	- Add -z option to write all SAC files to a ZIP archive.  The
	ZIP can be written to stdout.

2013.242:
	- Add check of derived sample rate versus reported sample rate.
	- Add -dr option to use the derived sample rate over the reported rate,
	this assumes that the timing is more accurate than the sampling rate.

2013.221:
	- Update to libmseed 2.11.
	- Change generated output file names to (no colons or commas):
	  Net.Sta.Loc.Chan.Qual.YYYY.DDD.HHMMSS.SAC
	which is consistent between between various operating systems.
	The previously generated file name patterns were:
	  Net.Sta.Loc.Chan.Qual.YYYY,DDD,HH:MM:SS.SAC (non-Windows)
	  Net.Sta.Loc.Chan.Qual.YYYY.DDD.HH_MM_SS.SAC (Windows)

	- Add -ic option to process each input channel individually.  When
	a new channel is detected all data previously read will be
	written.  Allows processing of very large input files without
	holding all of the data in memory.  Input miniSEED data should be
	well ordered, with all records for a channel contiguous in the
	file, when using this option.

2013.066: 1.9
	- Update to libmseed 2.10.
	- Change code to caluclate and populate station-event relative headers
	(az, baz, gcarc, dist) when a metadata file is used, previously this
	only worked when the station coordinates were supplied as command line
	options.
	- Fix detection of bad or incomplete lines in metadata file.

2012.216: 1.8
	- Allow metadata files to be delimited with vertical bars (|) in
	addition to commas.
	- When metadata files are delimited with vertical bars, assume the
	inclination is in SEED dip convention and convert to a SAC inclination.
	- Add logic to avoid overwriting existing file names, allows traces
	with the same start time to be converted.
	- Add -O option to explicitly overwrite existing files to support
	previous behavior.

2011.301:
	- Change time values in file names to be zero padded.

2011.066: 1.7
	- Change SEED naming override options to upper case (-N, -S, -L, -C).
	- Add -l option to take a selection list file to limit input data.
	- Add Makefile.win for MSVC Nmake.

2011.063:
	- Update to libmseed 2.6.
	- Create alternate output file names for Win32 that do not include 
	colon or comma characters, thanks to Claus Milkereit for reporting.
	- Fix crash for incomplete metadata lines, thanks to John Nabelek
	for reporting.
	- Reorganize help/usage message to common and extended versions, 
	use -h to get only common options and -H to get extended options.

2011.007:
	- Rework loop in SAC Alpha writing to avoid warning in newer GCCs.

2010.355: 1.6
	- Change format of metadata file and include new fields. A time
	window can now be specified in the metadata file and is used to
	match with appropriate data segments.
	- Allow comment lines in metadata file beginning with '#'.
	- Add warning when no metadata is available for inserting but a
	metadata file was suppliled.

2010.305:
	- Fix conversion for event time to not trim subseconds.

2010.138: 1.5
	- Update to libmseed 2.5.1.
	- Add -msi option to convert the component inclination in a supplied
	metadata file from SEED (dip) to SAC convention by adding 90 degrees.

2008.220: 1.4
	- Update to libmseed 2.1.6.

2007.284: 1.3
	- Update to libmseed 2.1.4.
	- Change src/Makefile to use user defined CFLAGS if specified.

2007.142: 1.2
	- Update to libmseed 2.1.1.
	- Fix reading of metadata file making it much more robust and
	clarify it's usage in the man page.

2007.133:
	- Store any sub-millisecond portion of the time in the begin (b)
	and end (e) header variables, these are offsets from the reference
	time which has only millisecond resolution.

2006.208: 1.1
	- Update to libmseed 1.8.
	- Use new get_errorstr() function for file read errors to print
	a useful diagnostic message.
	- Add gcc32, gcc32debug and gcc64debug targets to Makefile.

2006.184: 1.0
	- Update to libmseed 1.7.

2006.148: 0.4
	- Fix -k option to accept a negative latitudes (previously
	recognized as other command line options).

2006.138: 0.3
	- Add metadata file option to specify a file containing
	coordinates, scaling, orientation, etc.
	- Write man page.

2006.129:
	- Add delta, dist, azimuth and back azimuth calculation when
	both event and station coordinates are known.  Values are inserted
	into the appropriate SAC headers.

2006.127:
	- Add -E option to specify event information that will be inserted
	into the SAC header event variables.

2006.125: 0.1
	- Initial version.
